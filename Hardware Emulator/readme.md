The hardware emulator's purpose is to represent a standalone ECU's CANbus messages so that I can test, validate, and debug the software for the external control unit without having to physically be inside the car. This code will be ran on another microcontroller (Arduino), and will send the same CAN messages that the standalone ECU would. Current values are random, but the plan is to eventually have it display values from a real log to get a proper representation of what these values will be for proper algorithm testing and UI testing.
