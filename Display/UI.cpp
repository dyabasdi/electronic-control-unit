/* user interface for displaying important engine/vehicle parameters*/

/*

Should have the following:

- GPS based map of the track its on
- Accel Circle (in gs)
- Coolant temp, oil pressure, fuel pressure, ethanol %, gear (estimated from speed and RPM?)
- Buttons to start and stop logs, as well as save to external memory
    - add feature that checks to make sure that we have enough memory -> warning/feature unavailable if we're too close?
    - when we are close, stop the log and automatically save so that we have the most recent data
